# Octopus-agile-calendar-for-East-midland

this is an function based on python. Create by a student who live in budget. 
Due to budgeting purpose, I was not able to create an calender server to completely automate the entire process 
which taking agile price of Eastmidland district using Octopus API, and storing it as an .ics file, and making it ready to open and store into your local calender. 

By simpily modifly the address of API, which can be apply to different districts in the UK. 

which generated .ics file will be store in the same folder as the python script. 

No private Key is requried in this code. 

This can be fully automate by the combination of build in Automation Apps for MacOS, and Applescript which allow user to import the calander to a specific calendar account. Apple script required is store in a seperate file
